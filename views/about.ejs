      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Jhonatan Lopez Olguin</strong>, a Computer Programming and Analysis student with a strong passion for building real-world applications. I specialize in C++ for backend and systems programming, but I've also developed full-stack web apps using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
      </p>
      <p>
        My recent projects include a multithreaded order processing system using C++ and Oracle, a full e-commerce web app with image uploads and authentication, and a secure portfolio platform deployed with Vercel and Cloudinary. I'm constantly learning and currently focused on improving my skills with JavaScript and frontend frameworks.
